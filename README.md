# Revenue Operations & Sales Analytics Automation Pipeline

## Overview

This project simulates a modern Revenue Operations (RevOps) workflow for a fictional B2B SaaS company.

The system automates the full inbound lead lifecycle:
- lead capture
- lead scoring
- qualification logic
- geographic enrichment
- opportunity tracking
- sales notifications
- KPI reporting
- funnel analytics

The goal was to replicate how revenue teams combine operational automation with analytics to improve lead management and sales visibility.

# Business Problem

The company receives inbound leads from multiple acquisition channels but lacks:
- centralized lead tracking
- qualification consistency
- visibility into funnel performance
- automated sales notifications
- real-time reporting

Reporting was previously manual and delayed, making it difficult for stakeholders to evaluate:
- lead quality
- channel effectiveness
- conversion rates
- pipeline value

---

# Solution

Built an automated RevOps pipeline using:
- Google Forms
- Make
- Google Sheets
- REST APIs
- Slack
- Looker Studio

The workflow:
1. captures inbound leads
2. cleans and standardizes data
3. scores leads using business rules
4. enriches geographic information via API
5. stores structured operational data
6. alerts sales teams on high-value leads
7. tracks opportunity stage progression
8. visualizes KPIs and funnel performance
